## Project Overview

Learn Smart AI addresses the common challenge students face: turning dense lecture notes into effective, tailored study resources. By uploading your materials (PDF, TXT, DOCX, or PPTX), you instantly get:

- A dynamic **concept map** of topics/subtopics
- A bank of **AI-generated flashcards** (definitions, concepts)
- Smart, categorized **practice Q&A** (both factual and scenario-based)
- A **progress tracker**
- All content is editable, and exportable for offline study.

No sign-up or login is required — just click the link and start learning smarter!

## How Does the AI Work?

- Integrates Google Gemini LLM APIs.
- AI parses your study material, constructs a hierarchical map, and generates study content rooted strictly in your uploaded notes — no generic answers!
- All concept mapping, flashcard, and Q&A content can be **manually edited after generation** directly in the browser.
